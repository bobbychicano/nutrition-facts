## Bootstrap Nutrition Facts

The purpose of this project was to continue learning and practicing building with Bootstrap.

I chose to recreate the Hot Cheetos Nutrition Facts label using CSS grid. The most challenging part was setting up the styling in the beginning of the task, after that it was fairly simple to continue adding rows of information.
